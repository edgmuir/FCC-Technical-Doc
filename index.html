        <p>Before you can use Sass, you need to set it up on your project. If you just want to browse here, go ahead, but we recommend you install Sass first. <a href="#">Go here</a> if you want to learn how to get everything setup.</p>

      <article>
        <p>CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help.</p>
        <p>Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>variables</li>
          <li>nesting</li>
          <li>mixins</li>
          <li>inheritance</li>
          <li>other nifty goods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.</p>
        <p>The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running <em>sass input.scss output.css</em> from your terminal would take a single Sass file, <em>input.scss</em>, and compile that file to <em>output.css</em>.</p>
        <p>You can also watch individual files or directories with the <strong>--watch</strong> flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:</p>
        <code>sass --watch input.scss output.css</code>
        <p>You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:</p>
        <code>sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets</code>
        <p>Sass would watch all files in the <em>app/sass</em> folder for changes, and compile CSS to the <em>public/stylesheets</em> folder.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:</p>
        <p class="upper">Sass Syntax</p>
        <code>
          $font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif<br>
          $primary-color: #333<br>
          <br>
          body<br>
            font: 100% $font-stack<br>
            color: $primary-color
        </code>
        <p>When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the site.</p>
        <code>
          body {
            font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
            color: #333;
          }
        </code>

        <p>When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.</p>
        <p>Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a site's navigation:</p>
        <code>
          <pre>
            nav
              ul
                margin: 0
                padding: 0
                list-style: none<br>

              li
                display: inline-block<br>

              a
                display: block
                padding: 6px 12px
                text-decoration: none<br>
             </pre>
          </code>
        <p>You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the nav selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it more readable.</p>
        <p>When you generate the CSS you'll get something like this:</p>
        <br>
        <code>
          <pre>
            nav ul {
              margin: 0;
              padding: 0;
              list-style: none;
            }

            nav li {
              display: inline-block;
            }

            nav a {
              display: block;
              padding: 6px 12px;
              text-decoration: none;
            }
          </pre>
        </code>
      </article>
    </section>    
    <hr>    
    <section class="main-section" id="partials">
      <header>Partials</header>
      <article>
        <p>You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is simply a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like <em>_partial.scss</em>. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the <em>@import directive</em>.</p>
